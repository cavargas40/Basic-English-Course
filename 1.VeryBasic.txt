Substantives (noun), Verbs, etc...

Substantive (Noun):
    A substantive (it can also be called a "name") refers to one thing - a person, an object, an idea.

        Examples of Substantives:
            dog, house, apple, table, boy, water, street.

        Sustantives more abstracts:
            love, freedom, happiness, knowledge

        own names:
            they refer to specific and unique things:
                London, Mary, the President, Spain, Christmas

Verb:
    Describes an Action:

        walk, run, sleep, eat, do, speak, try, etc.

    there are also auxiliary verbs that do not describe literal actions, but rather are used to form verb tenses.
          later we will see the use of: do, does and did

    Modal verbs are to give nuances to verbs: should for suggestions, can for skills, etc.

Adjectives:
    the adjectives describe the nouns and they go before the noun (or a sentence after the verb to be)

        Examples of adjectives:

            A black cat
            A big house
            A small car
            A sunny day

Masculine and Femenine
    In English, the objects are neither masculine nor feminine
    the adjectives are then neutral and always unique
        Examples:
            Two big Sandwiches (Dos Bocadillos Grandes)
            Three easy questions (Tres preguntas faciles)
            Four interesting books (Esos cuatro libros interesantes)

Personal Pronouns
    Are:

    I (Yo)
    You (tú, usted, vosotros, ustedes)
    He (Él)
    She (Ella)
    It (Ello, Eso (Things without genre))
    We (Nosotros)
    They (Ellos, Ellas)

Structure of Phrases
    In English, phrases tend to follow the subject-verb-complement. the subject is mandatory
        Example:
